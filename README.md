VISUVALIZATION OF USING SQL AND POWER-Bi
This project combines SQL for data extraction and transformation with Power BI for visualization, aiming to provide comprehensive insights into sales and profit performance across various dimensions like Sales Rep, Customer, Region, and Time (Year/Month).
SQL (Structured Query Language)
Used to:
Extract raw data from relational databases.
Transform and clean data using commands like:SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE 
Aggregations: SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN()
Example SQL operations:Joining Sales and Customer tables,Calculating yearly profit per sales_rep.Filtering high-value transactions.

Power BI Desktop
Used for:
Data modeling:Building relationships between tables (Sales, Customers, Regions, Dates).Data transformation with Power Query Editor.
Creating measures with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):
Examples:
Avg_Sales = AVERAGE(Sales[SalesAmount])
Sum_Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])
Max_Sales = MAX(Sales[SalesAmount])

Bar Chart: Max_Sales, Min_Sales, and Avg_Sales by Sales_Rep
Purpose: Compare each sales rep’s highest, lowest, and average sales.
Clustered Column Chart: Sum of Profit and Sales by Sales_Rep and Region
X-Axis: Sales_Rep
Legend: Region
Y-Axis: Profit and Sales
Insight: Evaluates how each rep contributes to company performance regionally.

Stacked Column Chart: Sum of Sales and Profit by Customer and Sales_Rep
Purpose: Breaks down contributions from different customers.
Table & Chart: Max of Highest Sales by Sales_Rep and Region
Insight: Helps identify who hit the highest numbers in each region.
Total Column: Used for ranking and summing performance.
Insight: Visual comparison helps in identifying top and underperforming reps.

Matrix – Monthly and Yearly Profit per Rep
Breakdown of Avg_Profit, Min_Profit, Max_Profit by:Year, Month, Sales_Rep
To analyze sales and profit performance:
Across regions and time By sales reps and customers Using aggregates and visual insights
